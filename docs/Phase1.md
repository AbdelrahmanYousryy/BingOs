# Phase 1: Initial Kernel Development

## Overview  
This document summarizes the progress made before starting documentation.  

### Bootloader  
- Implemented a simple bootloader using assembly to load the kernel into memory.  
- **Challenges**: Understanding hardware initialization and debugging assembly code.  

### Paging System  
- Set up basic paging to manage virtual memory.  
- **Challenges**: Memory alignment issues during early debugging.

### Interrupt Handling  
- Added initial support for interrupt handling, including basic handlers for system calls.  
- **Challenges**: Debugging stack corruption issues when entering interrupt routines.

## Key Learnings  
- Improved understanding of how the CPU switches between real mode and protected mode.  
- Learned the basics of memory segmentation and paging.
